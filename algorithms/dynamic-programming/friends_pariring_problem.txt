Given n friends, each one can remain single or can be paired up with 
some other friend. Each friend can be paired only once. Find out the 
total number of ways in which friends can remain single or can be paired up.

Examples:

Input  : n = 3
Output : 4
Explanation
{1}, {2}, {3} : all single
{1}, {2,3} : 2 and 3 paired but 1 is single.
{1,2}, {3} : 1 and 2 are paired but 3 is single.
{1,3}, {2} : 1 and 3 are paired but 2 is single.
Note that {1,2} and {2,1} are considered same.


f(n) = ways n people can remain single 
       or pair up.

For n-th person there are two choices:
1) n-th person remains single, we recur 
   for f(n-1)
2) n-th person pairs up with any of the 
   remaining n-1 persons. We get (n-1)*f(n-2)

Therefore we can recursively write f(n) as:
f(n) = f(n-1) + (n-1)*f(n-2)

Since above recursive formula has overlapping subproblems, we can 
solve it using Dynamic Programming.
