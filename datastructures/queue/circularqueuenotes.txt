Circular Queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are 
performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position 
is connected back to the first position to make a circle. 
It is also called ‘Ring Buffer’. 

In a normal Queue, we can insert elements until queue becomes full. But once 
queue becomes full, we can not insert the next element even if there is a space 
in front of queue.


Operations on Circular Queue:

    Front: Get the front item from queue.
    Rear: Get the last item from queue.
    enQueue(value) This function is used to insert an element into the 
     circular queue. In a circular queue, the new element is always 
     inserted at Rear position.
        Steps:

        Check whether queue is Full – Check ((rear == SIZE-1 && front == 0) 
         || (rear == front-1)).
        If it is full then display Queue is full. If queue is not full then, 
         check if (rear == SIZE – 1 && front != 0) if it is true then set rear=0 
         and insert element.
    deQueue() This function is used to delete an element from the circular queue. 
    In a circular queue, the element is always deleted from front position.
        Steps:

        Check whether queue is Empty means check (front==-1).
        If it is empty then display Queue is empty. If queue is not empty then step 3
        Check if (front==rear) if it is true then set front=rear= -1 else check 
        if (front==size-1), if it is true then set front=0 and return the element.
