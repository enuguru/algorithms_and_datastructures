Minimum time required to rot all oranges
Given a matrix of dimension m*n where each cell in the matrix can 
have values 0, 1 or 2 which has the following meaning:

0: Empty cell

1: Cells have fresh oranges

2: Cells have rotten oranges 

The problem to determine what is the minimum time required so that 
all the oranges become rotten. A rotten orange at index [i,j] can 
rot other fresh orange at indexes [i-1,j], [i+1,j], [i,j-1], [i,j+1] 
(up, down, left and right). If it is impossible to rot every orange 
then simply return -1.

Examples:

Input:  arr[][C] = { {2, 1, 0, 2, 1},
                     {1, 0, 1, 2, 1},
                     {1, 0, 0, 2, 1}};
Output:
All oranges can become rotten in 2 time frames.


Input:  arr[][C] = { {2, 1, 0, 2, 1},
                     {0, 0, 1, 2, 1},
                     {1, 0, 0, 2, 1}};
Output:
All oranges cannot be rotten.
