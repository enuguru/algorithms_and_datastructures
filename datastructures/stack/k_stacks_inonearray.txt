The idea is to use two extra arrays for efficient implementation of k stacks in an array. This may not make much sense for integer stacks, but stack items can be large for example stacks of employees, students, etc where every item is of hundreds of bytes. For such large stacks, the extra space used is comparatively very less as we use two integer arrays as extra space.

Following are the two extra arrays are used:
1) top[]: This is of size k and stores indexes of top elements in all stacks.
2) next[]: This is of size n and stores indexes of next item for the items in array arr[]. Here arr[] is actual array that stores k stacks.
Together with k stacks, a stack of free slots in arr[] is also maintained. The top of this stack is stored in a variable ‘free’.

All entries in top[] are initialized as -1 to indicate that all stacks are empty. All entries next[i] are initialized as i+1 because all slots are free initially and pointing to next slot. Top of free stack, ‘free’ is initialized as 0.
