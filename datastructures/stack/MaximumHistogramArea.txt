Largest Rectangular Area in a Histogram

Find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram 
where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of contiguous bars. 
For simplicity, assume that all bars have same width and the width is 1 unit.

For example, consider the following histogram with 7 bars of heights 
{6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6}. The largest possible rectangle possible is 12 
(see the below figure, the max area rectangle is highlighted in red)
